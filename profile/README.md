# Webstir

Agent-powered tooling for building full-stack web apps without the ceremony. Webstir experiments with opinionated workflows, curated dependencies, and automation that keeps you in flow while the assistants handle the repetitive bits.

## Status
- Experimental and learning-focused — great for exploring ideas and workflows, not yet intended for production workloads.
- APIs, contracts, and workflows may change without notice while the ecosystem stabilizes.

## Start Here
- [Mission & Docs](https://github.com/webstir-io/webstir-portal/tree/main/docs) — vision, quick starts, and reference material
- [Workspace Framework](https://github.com/webstir-io/webstir-dotnet) — .NET core libraries, CLI, and build pipeline
- [Package Registry](https://github.com/orgs/webstir-io/packages) — published artifacts for frontend and backend providers

## Ecosystem Snapshot
- `webstir-frontend`: esbuild-powered build + publish pipeline for UI assets

- `webstir-dotnet`: .NET workspace framework, CLI, and automation hosts
- `webstir-testing`: test runner and harness aligned with the testing contract
